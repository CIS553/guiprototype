Initial GUI Prototype

To launch prototype, place all files in a single folder and open index.html in a web browser.  Development and testing was performed in Chrome.  The prototype was created with html, css, and javascript.  It does not handle or store any data.  The input fields are not functional and the data displayed is for demostration only.
